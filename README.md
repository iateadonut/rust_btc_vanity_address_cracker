Bitcoin Vanity Wallet
- If you want a wallet with a vanity word in it, like BUTT or something, this script can help you generate that wallet.  Just put a list of short words in target_substrings.txt and run the script through cargo, and you will eventually have your vanity wallet.

Bitcoin Wallet Cracker

- Cracking a BTC wallet is impossible and trying is a waste of resources.  Please don't do it.  If you're curious about the technical aspect, you can remove some lines and this script will let you know the approximate amount of time it would take to crack an address on your hardware.  (Hint: longer than the sun will live.)
